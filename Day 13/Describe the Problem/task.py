# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
"""The loop is setting the value of i to be between 1 and 19 (the end value of 20 isn't included."""
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
"""When the value of i is 20."""
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
"""That i won't get to be 20 because it's the end value."""
